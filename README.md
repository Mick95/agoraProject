# agoraProject
For this project I had to create a docker image that could launch the Agora server.

Agora server can be used to perform an online Design Space Exploration.
 
Agora server is a component of mARGOt.

mARGOt is a framework that provides to an application the ability to dinamically adapt in order to face changes
in the execution environment or in the application requirements.

The docker image is based on ubuntu:16.04.

# dependencies
The agora server needs several dependencies to work that are presented in the PowerPoint presentation.

# how to execute agora
there are 2 ways to execute the agora server, both of them are described in the PowerPoint presentation with pictures to guide the user.
